                    <h2>Volkswagen Beetle</h2> 
		            <p>The Volkswagen Beetle—officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in German der Käfer (meaning "beetle"), 
                       in parts of the English-speaking world the Bug, and known by many other nicknames in other languages—is a 
                       two-door, rear-engine economy car, intended for five occupants (later, Beetles were restricted to four people
                       in some countries), that was manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 
                       2003.
                    </p>        
		            <p>The need for a people's car (Volkswagen in German), its concept and its functional objectives were formulated
                       by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country's
                       new road network (Reichsautobahn). Members of the National Socialist party, with an additional dues surcharge, 
                       were promised the first production, but the Spanish Civil War shifted most production resources to military 
                       vehicles to support the Nationalists under Francisco Franco.
                    </p>    
		            <p>Lead engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. Béla Barényi[16] is credited 
                       with first conceiving the original design for this car in 1925, notably by Mercedes-Benz, on their website, 
                       including his original technical drawing,[17][18] five years before Porsche claimed to have done his initial 
                       version.[19] The influence on Porsche's design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570, and the work
                       of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute.[20] The result was the first Volkswagen, and one of the first 
                       rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,[21] the Beetle is the longest-running and 
                       most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.
		            </p>
		            <p>Although designed in the 1930s, due to World War II, civilian Beetles only began to be produced in significant
                       numbers by the end of the 1940s. The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed 
                       simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the former
                       three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the model number.
                    </p>        

		            <p>The car became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle", cognate with English 
                        chafer) and was later marketed under that name in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For
                        example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug). In 1943, Roy Fedden applied for
                        a patent, GB570814, 'Improvements relating to road vehicles', a car very similar to the Type 1 with a 
                        radial engine and sprung suspension..
		
                    </p>The original 25 hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100 km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable 
                        cruising speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output
                        was boosted to 36, then 40 hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" 
                        Volkswagen motor. The Beetle gave rise to multiple variants: mainly the 1950 Type 2 'Bus', the 1955
                        Karmann Ghia, as well as the 1961 Type 3 'Ponton' and the 1968 Type 4 (411/412) family cars, ultimately 
                         forming the basis of an entirely rear-engined VW product range.
                    
                    <p>The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, and then by Fiat and Renault, whereby the rear-engine,
                         rear-wheel-drive layout increased from 2.6 percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6
                          percent in 1956.In 1959 even General Motors launched an air-cooled, rear-engined car, the Chevrolet Corvair—which 
                          even shared the Beetle's flat engine and swing axle architecture.

                    <p>Citroën 2CV 
                        The Citroën 2CV (French: deux chevaux(-vapeur), pronounced [dø ʃ(ə)vo (vapœʁ)], lit. "two steam horse(power)s",
                        meaning "two taxable horsepower") is an air-cooled front-engine, front-wheel-drive, economy family car, introduced 
                         at the 1948 Paris Mondial de l'Automobile, and manufactured by Citroën for model years 1948–1990.
                    </p>    
                    
                    <p> Conceived by Citroën Vice-President Pierre Boulanger[4] to help motorise the large number of farmers still using 
                        horses and carts in 1930s France, the 2CV has a combination of innovative engineering and straightforward, 
                        utilitarian bodywork — at first with extra thin panels, reinforced by corrugating the metal. The 2CV featured 
                        overall low cost of ownership, simplicity of maintenance, an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering
                        9 hp), and minimal fuel consumption. In addition, it had literally been designed to cross a freshly ploughed field,
                        because of the great lack of paved roads in France then; with a long-travel suspension system, that connects
                        front and rear wheels, giving a very soft ride.
                    </p>    
                
                    <p>Often called "an umbrella on wheels", the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back 
                        sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads, and until 1955 even stretched to cover the car's trunk, reaching almost
                        down to the car's rear bumper.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Michelin introduced and first commercialised the revolutionary new radial tyre design with the introduction of the 2CV.
                    </p>   
                
                    <p>Manufactured between 1948 and 1990, more than 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, making it the world's first front-wheel 
                        drive car to become a million seller, after Citroën's own, more upscale Traction Avant was the first front-wheel drive
                        car to sell in six-figure numbers. The 2CV platform spawned many variants, as detailed in the "Production numbers" 
                        section. The 2CV and its variants are collectively known as the A-Series.  Notably these include the 2CV-based delivery
                        vans known as fourgonnettes, the Ami, the Dyane, the Acadiane, and the Mehari. In total, Citroën manufactured over 9
                        million of the 2CVs and its derivative models.
                    </p>    
                
                    <p>A 1953 technical review in Autocar described "the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most
                        original since the Model T Ford".[16] In 2011, The Globe and Mail called it a "car like no other". The motoring writer
                        L. J. K. Setright described the 2CV as "the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car", 
                        and a car of "remorseless rationality".
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Both the design and the history of the 2CV mirror the Volkswagen Beetle in significant ways. Conceived in the 1930s, to
                         make motorcars affordable to regular people for the first time in their countries, both went into large scale 
                         production in the late 1940s, featuring air-cooled boxer engines at the same end as their driven axle, omitting a 
                         length-wise drive shaft, riding on exactly the same 2,400 mm (94.5 in) wheelbase, and using a platform chassis to 
                         facilitate the production of derivative models. Just like the Beetle, the 2CV became not only a million seller, but
                          also one of the few cars in history to continue a single generation in production for over four decades.

                    <p>Fiat 500
		               In 1936, Fiat released the front engine Fiat 500 "Topolino" economy car. In 1949 to meet the demands of the post-war market, 
                       production resumed as the 500C with revised front and rear bodywork. It had a 2-door coupe body with sun-roof, which was 
                       later complemented by an Estate version. Both continued until 1957 when they were replaced by an all-new, lighter car. 
                       The new car had a rear-mounted engine, on the pattern of the Volkswagen Beetle, just like its bigger brother the 1955 Fiat
                       600. Several car makers followed the now uncommon rear engine configuration at the time and were quite successful. The
                       Neckar version of the 500 was manufactured in Heilbronn under a complicated deal involving NSU, and was introduced in 
                       October 1961.[2] Steyr-Puch produced cars based on the Fiat 500 under licence in Graz, Austria.
                    </p>
		            <p>Despite its very small size, the 500 proved to be an enormously practical vehicle with large sales throughout 
                        Europe. Besides the two-door coupé, it was also available as the "Giardiniera" estate; this variant featured 
                        the standard engine laid on its side, the wheelbase lengthened by 10 cm (3.9 in) to provide a more convenient
                        rear seat, a full-length sunroof and larger brakes from the Fiat 600.
                    </p>    
		            <p>Sports models were produced by Abarth, as well as by Giannini. An Austrian variant, produced by Steyr-Daimler-Puch,
                        the 1957–1973 Steyr-Puch 500, had a motorcycle-derived Puch boxer twin motor, a sports model of which was the 
                        1965–1969 Steyr-Puch 650 TR2.
                    </p>
		            <p>Production of the 500 ended in 1975, although its replacement, the Fiat 126, was launched two years earlier. The 
                        126 was not as successful as its predecessor in Italy, but sold well in the Eastern Bloc countries, being
                        assembled and manufactured in Poland as a Polski Fiat. The Fiat 500 has a Cx (aerodynamic resistance coefficient)
                        of 0,38, a very good performance for its time.
